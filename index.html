So much so, he decided to take on 40 marathons in 40 days, but not just for any reason. For us. To raise money for those battling cancer today.</p>

	<p>Sam and his wife, Sandy, love playing golf together. The fresh air, the exercise, the views. Sam is especially good at chipping from just off the green. But when Sam found out that a swollen lymph gland was cancerous, he didn’t realize just how quickly the treatment would bring his life, and Sandy’s, to a halt.</p>

	<p>After the radiation, Sam found himself losing weight, coordination, balance and energy. Sandy knew he needed something to start him back on the road to recovery. When she saw in the local paper that the LIVESTRONG Foundation was working with cancer survivors at the YMCA, she knew it could change their life.</p>

			<p>At the LIVESTRONG Foundation, our mission is to inspire and empower people affected by cancer today. We do this by striving to fundamentally change the expectations and experience of living with cancer. As an organization, we don’t believe in doing things the way they’ve always been done. We approach our mission from more than one angle: we develop and deploy programs that provide direct service to those who need it while advocating at the global, federal and state levels for legislation that will improve the lives of cancer survivors.</p>

			<p>2013 and beyond are no different. Over the course of the next three years, we will focus on the following priorities:</p>
			
			<div class="col50 clr3">
			<figure>Ensure anyone affected by cancer has access to patient-centered navigation services</figure>
			</div>
			<div class="col50">
			<figure>Elevate the patient’s voice to fundamentally change the way cancer is experienced and understood</figure>
			</div>
			<div class="col50 clr3">
			<figure>Engage communities to collab-oratively and comprehensively implement patient-centered approaches that positively impact people affected by cancer</figure>
			</div>
			<div class="col50">
			<figure>Create the foremost brand association with living life to the fullest in the face of cancer</figure>

				<h3 class="thin">Mike Amann</h3>
				<p>Mike Amann led the design of the Annual Report you’re reading right now. And he screen printed the cover, with its layers of meaning. Mike is not just a graphic designer, 
					but he’s a new father, a husband, a son, a brother, a friend, a warrior and an inspiration. Mike is fighting a vicious Neuroendocrine Cancer right now and was doing so 
					throughout the entire design process of this book. Chemo on Mondays, hospital visits far too often, surgeries scheduled for after this book is printed... Didn’t matter. 
					He showed up to his studio in Covington, Kentucky, every day he could, with Juno the Doberman by his side. His passion for telling the stories of LIVESTRONG through his 
					art rose to the top. His craftsmanship outdueled cancer every day of the week. And his drive doesn’t stop there, as Mike will be taking on his cancer with a breakthrough 
					surgical approach that will help educate the cancer medical community for the future.</p>

				<p>This is Mike Amann. And this is what LIVESTRONG is all about.</p>
